# Introduction

Most chat components can be customized, this document shows how to do it.

The customizations can be changed in the config file `solstice.conf`, under the `formats` section.

These formattings make use of [Simplified Text Format](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/) and [Placeholders](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/default-placeholders/).

!!! note

    The text formats will try to use the player context in placeholders whenever possible.
