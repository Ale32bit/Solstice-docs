# Modules

Modules bring functionalities and commands to Solstice.

Each command added by a module has its own permission node, in the format of `solstice.command.mycommand`, some commands may have additional sub permission nodes, appended after the command name (e.g. `solstice.command.mycommand.subcommand`).

Check out the left side bar for a list of documented modules.
