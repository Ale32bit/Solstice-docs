# Ignite

This module adds the `/ignite` command to allow you to set players on fire.

## Commands

!!! command "ignite [players] [ticks]"

    !!! note inline end

        A tick is a time unit equivalent to a 20th of a second.

        1 tick = 50ms. 20 ticks = 1 second.

    Set players on fire.

    The argument `players` defaults to the player that executed the command.

    The argument `ticks` defaults to `200` (10 seconds).
