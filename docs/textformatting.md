# Text formatting

Solstice makes use of the [Simplified Text Format](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/) to format text messages present in `locale.json`, some of the configurations and in many features.

[Placeholders](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/default-placeholders/) can also be used to dynamically replace text based on the context.

!!! note

    The text formats will try to use the player context in placeholders whenever possible.
